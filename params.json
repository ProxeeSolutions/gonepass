Use Gonepassword!\r\n\r\n## Building\r\nBuilding gonepassword assumes you have the following things installed on your system\r\n* Gtk+3\r\n* Openssl\r\n* Jansson (https://jansson.readthedocs.org/en/2.7/)\r\n* pkg-config\r\n* GNU make\r\n* a working C compiler\r\n\r\nRight now it's only been tested on Gnome 3, so milage may vary.\r\n\r\nA real build system is coming, I promise! For now just run make, and it will produce an executable called gonepassapp.\r\n\r\n## Great, now what?\r\nWhen you start one password point it at your password vault in Dropbox. You should select the folder that ends with `agilekeychain` and type in your master password.\r\n\r\nIf you want to load up multiple password vaults, just go to the Application menu and click `Load`, it will pop up a new window for selecting another password vault.\r\n\r\nThe window for selecting password vaults will remember the last password vault it successfully loaded.\r\n\r\n## That's pretty useful, can I update my items?\r\nNot yet, sorry.\r\n\r\n## Something isn't working?\r\nSorry about that, open an issue.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
